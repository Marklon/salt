************************************************Configuring Salt ********************************************************


# MASTER CONFIGURATION
# By default the Salt master listens on ports 4505 and 4506 on all interfaces (0.0.0.0). To bind Salt to a 
# specific IP, redefine the "interface" directive in the master configuration file, typically /etc/salt/master, as follows:


# - #interface: 0.0.0.0
# + interface: ip of master


# MINION CONFIGURATION
# Although there are many Salt Minion configuration options, configuring a Salt Minion is very simple. 
# By default a Salt Minion will try to connect to the DNS name "salt"; if the Minion is able to resolve that name 
# correctly, no configuration is needed.

If the DNS name "salt" does not resolve to point to the correct location of the Master, redefine the "master" 
directive in the minion configuration file, typically /etc/salt/minion, as follows:

# - #master: salt
# + master: 10.0.0.1


# After updating the configuration file, restart the Salt minion.
$ systemctl restart salt-minion


# KEY IDENTITY
# Salt provides commands to validate the identity of your Salt master and Salt minions before the initial key exchange. 
# Validating key identity helps avoid inadvertently connecting to the wrong Salt master, and helps prevent a potential 
# MiTM attack when establishing the initial connection.

# MASTER KEY FINGERPRINT
# Print the master key fingerprint by running the following command on the Salt master:

$ salt-key -F master

# Accepting The Salt key on the master
$ sudo salt-key -a name-of-minion 
# -A flag will accept all keys from all minions





# Add the Firewall Rules to the iptables configuration
# Add the following lines to that line, but be sure to do it above the line that says DROP:


$ vi /etc/sysconfig/iptables-config
-A INPUT -m state --state new -m tcp -p tcp --dport 4505 -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -m state --state new -m tcp -p tcp --dport 4506 -j ACCEPT
